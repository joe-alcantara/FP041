Week 7 - Evaluation of Classification Models
- Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, Confusion Matrices, F1 Score and Area Under the Curve

Introduction:

Welcome to this lecture on the various methods used to evaluate classification models.
Evaluating the performance of a classification model is crucial for assessing its accuracy and effectiveness.
In this lecture, we will explore several key evaluation metrics and techniques used in the field of machine learning.
Importance of Model Evaluation:

Model evaluation helps us understand how well a classification model is performing.
It provides insights into a model's strengths and weaknesses.
Evaluation metrics guide model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and ultimately, decision-making in real-world applications.
Common Evaluation Metrics:

There are several common evaluation metrics used for classification models:
1. Accuracy:

Accuracy is the most straightforward metric, measuring the ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total number of instances.
It is suitable when classes are balanced, but it may not be informative for imbalanced datasets.
2. Precision:

Precision measures the ratio of true positives (correctly predicted positive instances) to the total predicted positive instances.
It focuses on the accuracy of positive predictions and is useful when minimizing false positives is essential.
3. Recall (Sensitivity or True Positive Rate):

Recall measures the ratio of true positives to the total actual positive instances.
It assesses the model's ability to identify all positive instances and is essential when minimizing false negatives is critical.
4. F1-Score:

The F1-Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
It provides a balance between precision and recall, making it suitable for imbalanced datasets.
5. ROC Curve (Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve):

The ROC curve plots the true positive rate (recall) against the false positive rate at various decision thresholds.
It helps visualize a model's trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.
The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC) quantifies the overall performance of the model.
6. Precision-Recall Curve:

The precision-recall curve plots precision against recall for different decision thresholds.
It is particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets and focuses on positive class predictions.
7. Confusion Matrix:

A confusion matrix provides a detailed breakdown of a model's predictions.
It includes counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
Methods of Evaluation:

Model evaluation involves various techniques to assess a classification model's performance:
1. Cross-Validation:

Cross-validation (e.g., k-fold cross-validation) splits the dataset into multiple subsets (folds) for training and testing.
It helps estimate a model's performance on unseen data and reduces overfitting.
2. Train-Test Split:

A common approach is to split the dataset into a training set and a testing set.
The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set.
3. Stratified Sampling:

When dealing with imbalanced datasets, stratified sampling ensures that the training and testing sets maintain the same class distribution.
4. Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV):

LOOCV is a special case of cross-validation where each data point is treated as a test sample once, and the model is trained on the remaining data.
It is useful for small datasets but can be computationally expensive.
Conclusion:

Evaluating classification models is a critical step in the machine learning workflow.
Various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curves, and confusion matrices, provide insights into model performance.
Techniques like cross-validation, train-test splits, and stratified sampling help ensure robust evaluation.
